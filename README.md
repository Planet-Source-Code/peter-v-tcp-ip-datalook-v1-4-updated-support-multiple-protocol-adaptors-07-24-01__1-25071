### Description

UPDATED!!(07-24-2001)<BR>

Support now Multiple IP,protocol adaptors !<BR>

Check,look the data on TCP-IP sockets.

Now with 'Extra' , that shows a option menu per Connection you make.(clearscreen - Data change for Client appl - Connect/Disconnect button - Help box)<BR><BR>

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:::: <BR>

----

<BR>

View the data on a socket between Client application & Server application.<BR>

(With this program you can use multiple connections-sockets)<BR>

So with this program you can see (visual) the data between example outlook & ISP-pop3 server.

You can also save the data for further study.<BR>

If you have example a internet application,

Direct Connect,mirc..ect, let this client appl connect to my program & let my program connect the needed server, so now you have the possibility to view the data between server & client.. so you can study it & make maybe a own clone application that uses the protocol , data you've captured.. <BR><BR>

HOW IT WORKS: <BR>

----

<BR>

Let a client appl not connect to the server, but to the local ip & port of your pc..<BR>

Now click on the new connection button,<BR>

& lets listen on the port where the client appl will connect to..(fill down the port!)<BR>

Put in the box connecting to the dns or ip & port where my appl will connect to (in that case the ip & port of the server).<BR>

So you have now the possibility to view the data between server & client..<BR>

You can also save the captured data to DISK !<BR>

(And you can it open later...)<BR>

Try the program & test the new options ! <BR>

With this application , you also can see the local used ports & where they are connected to..

(that part of code i've borrowed here..)<BR><BR>

Have fun ! and view now the protocols that you doesn't know yet....<BR><BR>

PS: Please Vote for me !<BR><BR>

.... See my other stuff on PSC..<BR>
